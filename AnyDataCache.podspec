'This datacaching library has following features: \
1. Caching data on background thread. \
2. You can set expiry time and it will delete data automatically after expiry time. \
3. You can specify disk space in MBs and library will automatically delete old items if disk spce is more than the limit set. \
4. You can mark an item for "autodelete" which is by default true. So it is set to false, librery wont delete such items and will wait for your instructions to delete them.'
